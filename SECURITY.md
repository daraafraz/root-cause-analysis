# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is a static prototype application using mock data. Security updates are provided for the current version only.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |

## Security Note

**This application does not handle sensitive data, network I/O, or code execution.**

This is a frontend-only static prototype that:
- Uses mock/simulated data
- Does not connect to external services
- Does not process user input beyond UI interactions
- Does not store or transmit any data

## Reporting a Vulnerability

While this application is designed to be safe, if you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not open a public issue** - Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately
2. **Contact the maintainer** - Open a private security advisory on GitHub or contact the repository maintainer
3. **Include:**
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

## Response Time

We aim to respond to security reports within 5 business days. Given that this is a prototype with no sensitive data handling, response times may vary.

## Scope

This security policy applies to:
- The application codebase
- Dependencies and their security updates
- Deployment configuration

Since this is a static prototype, the security surface is minimal. However, we take security seriously and will address any legitimate concerns.
